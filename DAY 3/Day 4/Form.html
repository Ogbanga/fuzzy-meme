        <p class="P2"> “In the second half it was controlled and calm, but even then we lost a player in Firmino.
            We had incredible chances, so the game was nearly perfect. They were much more on the front foot than in their home game.
            But then two incredible balls from Trent, and incredible finishes as well. We don’t want to play against ten men, we don’t like that.
            I didn’t understand why their goal was offside. But in the end it was 2-0, a great night.</p>
